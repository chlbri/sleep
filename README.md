# The Ultimate package to sleep 🛌 😪 like a baby 👩🏾‍🍼

<br/>

With this function (
[sleep](https://github.com/chlbri/sleep/blob/dev/src/index.ts) ), you can
sleep the time you want !

## _Example_

```typescript
import sleep from '@bemedev/sleep';

const myCoolFunction = async () => {
  // Go to sleep
  await sleep(2); // 100 milliseconds by default

  // Sleeping...
  // Sleeping...

  // And wake up !
  console.log("I'm awake");
};
```

I don't know why the core-js team doesn't include this one. So I write the
simplest package in the **entire history** of
[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com).

### Enjoy your sleep

_Maybe new ways to sleep will arrive soon_ 😯 _!_
