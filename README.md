# The Ultimate package to sleep

 <br>

With this function ( [sleep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bemedev/sleep)
), you can sleep the time you want !

I don't why the core-js team doesn't inclue this one. So I write the
simplest package in the **entire history** of
[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com). <br> <br>

### Enjoy your sleep

_Maybe new ways to sleep can come ðŸ˜¯!_
