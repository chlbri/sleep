# The Ultimate package to sleep 🛌 😪 like a baby 👩🏾‍🍼

 <br>

With this function ( [sleep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bemedev/sleep)
), you can sleep the time you want !

I don't why the core-js team doesn't inclue this one. So I write the
simplest package in the **entire history** of
[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com). <br> <br>

### Enjoy your sleep

_Maybe new ways to sleep will arrive soon_ 😯 _!_
